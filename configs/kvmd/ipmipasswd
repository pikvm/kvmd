# This file describes the credentials for IPMI users in format "login:password",
# one per line. The passwords are NOT encrypted.
#
# WARNING! IPMI protocol is completely unsafe by design. In short, the authentication
# process for IPMI 2.0 mandates that the server send a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the
# requested user's password to the client, prior to the client authenticating.
#
# NEVER use the same passwords for KVMD and IPMI users.
# This default configuration is shown here just for the example only.
