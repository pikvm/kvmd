		| This PiKVM device has running #[b kvmd-ipmi] daemon and provides IPMI 2.0 interface for some basic
		| BMC operations like on/off/reset the server.
	p.text
		| #[b WARNING!] We strongly don't recommend you to use IPMI in untrusted networks because
		| this protocol is completely unsafe by design. In short, the authentication process for IPMI mandates
		| that the server send a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the requested user's password to the client,
		| prior to the client authenticating.
	p.text
		| #[b NEVER] use the same passwords for KVMD and IPMI users. And even better not to use IPMI.
		| Instead, you can directly use KVMD API via curl. Here some examples:
